# PyGame-GUI exampls

## Introduction
This repository contains examples and demonstrations of creating a GUI within the Pygame framework. These examples are designed to showcase various GUI components and interactions possible in Pygame.
### Developed by whom?
This project was developed by a group of elementary and middle school students on the [fishc.com.cn](url) aka Fish C forum.
Thereinto:
 - @cjjJasonchen led the development
 - @歌者文明清理员 (github: dddddgz) and @zhangchenyun (github: zcyyyyyyyyyy) for initial release on GitHub.
 - Yuyou (people that registered accounts on fishc forum) has given great support to the development team.
### Why Develop?
For the same reason, there are so few GUIs for PyGame that you have to build wheels every time!
### How to develop?
Development can be divided into the following parts:
 1. Discuss the development steps on the Fish C forum
 2. Developed by @cjjJasonchen
 3. Publish the source code on the Fish C forum for a wide range of Yuyou discussions.
 4. Improve based on the results of the discussion.
 5. Published on GitHub by @歌者文明清理员 (github: dddddgz) and @zhangchenyun (github: zcyyyyyyy).
 6. (Long-term planning) Published on the PyPI community.
Creating a README.md file is crucial for any GitHub repository as it provides essential information about the project, how to set it up, and how to use it. Here's a basic template for a README.md you could use for your Pygame GUI examples repository:
## Getting Started
### Examples
- **text-edit.py**: Demonstrates a basic text editor with font selection and text input.
- **complexd-chooser-box**: An interface to choose any thing.
- **push-button**: An interface to choose a thing.
- **scorll-bar**: An simple scorll bar.
### Prerequisites
Before you can run these examples, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.7.1+
- Pygame library
You can install Pygame using pip if you don't have it already:
```bash
pip install pygame
```
### Installation
Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zcyyyyyyyyyy/PygameGUI-examples.git
```
Navigate to the directory where you cloned the repo and you will find the various example scripts.
### Running the Examples
To run any of the example scripts, navigate to the appropriate directory in your terminal or command prompt and execute the python file. For example:
```bash
python example_script.py
```
Replace `example_script.py` with the actual script you wish to run.
